                <p> The research was one of the biggest parts of the project. I started by analyzing the data collected from different analytics tools. After I completed the demographic research, merged these outputs with the Marketing and Sales analysis of the company to clarify the segments. </p>
                <p> Atlasglobal has passengers from a variety of domains, analyzing the user segments and using these segments to create the Personas was a quite difficult task for me. Especially, segmentation was defined mostly for marketing and sales purposes. That's why I decided to create 6 different personas by considering the travel behaviours. </p>
                 <p> During this process, I also started to analyze the current user flows on the website and the apps. My first step was reviewing booking, check-in and manage booking steps by myself. The next step was making the same process with real users. I and my team-mates conducted interviews with 15 different passengers who have been flying with both Atlasglobal and other airlines to observe and learn their paths on the website and the apps.</p>
                 <p> Since the project scope was designing the website, apps and the kiosk devices optimizing one the platform wouldn't be enough. We needed to find the pain-points during all the journey and the best way to do that was having interviews of all the parties of the flow from Call Center representatives to counter crew in the airport and also 3rd party travel agencies. So, we spend 3 days at the call centre listening to the passengers and learning from their experiences, spent 2 days at the airport to observe passengers interacting with kiosk devices and waiting on the Counter lines. Also, went to the 3rd party agencies to learn their sales flow and passenger communications.</p>
                 <p> This interviews showed us we needed to create a rich Support Platform and clear explanations during the Check-in, Booking and Manage Booking Flows. </p>
                 <p> While I was handling the interviews, my teammates started benchmarking of the world's 50 biggest airlines. That way we could see the best practices and different approaches in the sector. </p>
                 <p> After completing all the research process, we were ready to create an optimized user journey that guides us to a better information architecture. </p>
